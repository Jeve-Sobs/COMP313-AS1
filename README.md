Game Description Ogre Survival 

What is the main game mechanic
The primary game mechanic in my game is you need to kill a wave of ogres to advance to the next wave.  You need to collect ammo boxes which spawn at 3 locations around the map at the end of each round. 

What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal
The hardest part of the game to get working was the animations. I kept running into errors and the animations didn’t look smooth. I made blendspaces to blend the different animations together and when used montages for other animations such as attacking. I ran into many issues with animating because the animations I used had animation curves which caused issues and I didn’t understand how to use them. 

What is the most interesting part of the game
The most interesting part of my game is the graphics. I put a lot of time into making the game look really good. I found quixel bridge very helpful and I enjoyed using all the free assets epic games published on their store. 

Reflection on learning
I really enjoyed this assignment because it was a great way to improve a wide range of skills and I found that if I got bored working on something I could just work on something completely different tand come back to it. This was great when I got bored of programming I would just work on the map design or UI design. Even though I put countless hours into this assignment I feel like I have barely scratched the surface on Unreal Engines capabilities and there's so much more I want to learn.
